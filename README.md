This repository explores next-word prediction in NLP using advanced deep learning techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers. It covers the importance of next-word prediction in applications like text completion and chatbots, compares traditional models with deep learning approaches, and discusses challenges such as data scarcity and computational efficiency. Solutions like transfer learning and model pruning are explored to address these challenges. The repository provides implementation steps for building and evaluating models, and outlines future directions including domain-specific knowledge integration and multi-modal input. It aims to advance understanding and development of efficient next-word prediction systems in modern NLP applications.
